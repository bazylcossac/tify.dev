## Why NextJS? ü§î
Simple. I wanted to build application using Next.JS. It was fun, sometimes not. Its important to be aware of pros and cons of technology you use. Would i use Next.JS to build another social media app? It depends. But with today's knowledge, would i use Next.JS again? Absolutely, because i discovered a advatages and disadvantages of this technology, so i have another point of view of web technologies and that is the most important thing that this project gave me.
